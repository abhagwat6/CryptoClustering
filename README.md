# CryptoClustering
Module 11 Challenge
#**Scaling Data, Clustering by using the Elbow Method and Principle Component Analysis**
##The challenge requires sclaing of the Crypto market data by using StandardScaler library.
##The data are then clustered.
##The clustered data are then plotted by using the Elbow method to find the optimum number of clusters.
##The clustered data are then analyzed for predictions and variances.
##The data are also processed by Principle Component Analysis (PCA). 
##The predictions and variances are then compared with the Scaled method for differences.
